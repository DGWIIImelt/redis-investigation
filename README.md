super quick and dirty node app,

the redisDemo.js was a direct copy/paste from some tutorial

I started pushing data from a local file to avoid hammering intercom with requests each time I fiddled with the file

as for working with it, 
I had redis-server running in one terminal, 
ran my node app in another terminal, 
and then in a third terminal I was using the redis-cli to make queries.
